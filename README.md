EDA: Gender Inequality & Women Safety in India 🇮🇳
“Data can’t fix injustice, but it can expose it.”
📊 This project dives into the uncomfortable truth of gender-based violence in India using real-world crime statistics and health indicators. The goal: insights ➡ awareness ➡ action.

🔍 What's Inside?
We performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on gender inequality and crimes against women across India. This analysis helps answer questions like:

❓ Which states are most unsafe for women?

📈 Are crimes increasing or decreasing over time?

🎓 Does education level impact safety?

🌐 How do urban vs rural trends differ?

All of this was done using interactive and static visualizations to bring the numbers to life.
